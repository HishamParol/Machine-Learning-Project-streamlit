# About Airbnb 
The Airbnb dataset contains details of Airbnb listings for New York City for several years up to and 
including 2019. The dataset includes the location, various details about the host and property, along 
with price and some details about reviews.
I took two approaches to this dataset. I looked at predictions based on price using regression 
models, as price is a continuous variable. And looking at predictions based on popularity of listings, 
which were classification problems.

# Hypothesis
My hypotheses are grouped into price predictions and popularity predictions. Some of which could 
be easily visualised and others through modelling.
• Which hosts are the busiest and why?
• What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)
• What can we learn about different hosts and areas? (which areas are expensive/best)
•Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for 
it?
•What type of listings are there in New York City? (Private room, Apartment etc)
